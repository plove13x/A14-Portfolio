                    Ever since I made my first website (<span class="rollIt">NHRT<span class="purps2">*</span></span>) in high school and witnessed it take the student body by storm, I've been hooked by the power of the web. Upon graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, though, I wanted to try my hand at a few different endeavors and continue to shape my mind and character through extensive travel. I kept dabbling in web development through freelance projects, but I came full circle in 2014 when I decided (from a cramped hostel bunk bed in Lima, Peru) it was time to take my web skills to the next level and enroll in an intensive 12-week "code school" back in the States. <!-- I'm still a citizen of the world, but now I'm more empowered to effectively communicate with all my fellow inhabitants on Earth.

                            When my instructor assigned this homework project over a long weekend, I was ecstatic. After all, I lived in Thailand and it always pains me to pay $15 at a Thai joint in America for a dish I used to eat on the street for less than a dollar. So don't be alarmed when you notice all the prices are listed in Thai Baht, as I promise the food is up to par and - Thai fare or not - now I'm ready to help any restaurant accept orders from their website!

                        This one was fun. My skills have come a long way since I made it and there are some aspects I would code differently if I did it all over again, but back in the day I used to love playing Final Fantasy RPGs, so writing damage algorithms for the first time and then experiencing my dynamic gameplay come to life during testing was definitely rewarding.
