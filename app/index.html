                    Ever since I made my first website (<span class="rollIt">NHRT<span class="purps2">*</span></span>) in high school and witnessed it take the student body by storm, I've been hooked by the power of the web. Upon graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, though, I tried my hand at a few different jobs and continued to shape my mind and character through extensive travel. Although I continued to dabble in web development through freelance projects, I came full circle in 2014 when I decided (from a cramped hostel bunk bed in Lima, Peru) it was time to take my web skills to the next level and enroll in an intensive 12-week "code school" back in the States. <!-- I'm still a citizen of the world, but now I'm more empowered to effectively communicate with all my fellow inhabitants on Earth.

                            When my instructor assigned this homework project over a long weekend, I was ecstatic. After all, I lived in Thailand and it always pains me to pay $15 at a Thai joint in America for a dish I used to eat on the street for less than a dollar. So don't be alarmed when you notice all the prices are listed in Thai Baht, as I promise the food is up to par and - Thai fare or not - now I'm ready to help any restaurant accept orders from their website!

                        This one was fun. My skills have come a long way since I made it and there are some aspects I would code differently if I did it all over again, but back in the day I used to love playing Final Fantasy RPGs, so writing damage algorithms for the first time and then experiencing my dynamic gameplay come to life during testing was definitely rewarding.

No, we didn't reap the financial rewards of such a stroke of mixology brilliance - the idealists we were in high school couldn't have been less concerned with intellectual property rights and patents. We just wanted to stir up better flavors of Gatorade for all to enjoy. But making this site made me see the light for the first time.
